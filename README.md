# lcr-modules: Standardizing genomic analyses

This project aims to become a collection of standard analytical modules for genomic and transcriptomic data. Too often do we copy-paste from each otherâ€™s pipelines, which has several pitfalls. Fortunately, all of these problems can be solved with standardized analytical modules, and the benefits are many.
