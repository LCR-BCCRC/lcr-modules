TCRB Open Access Data on DNAnexus

The Texas Cancer Research Biobank (TCRB) and Baylor College of Medicine Human
Genome Sequencing Center (BCM-HGSC) have sequenced tumor and normal genomes of
patients who consented to make their data broadly available for biomedical
research â€” under the condition that end users never attempt to re-identify
participants.

Further details about the consented cases can be found at:

These tumor and normal specimen BAM, somatic variant MAF and germline MAF
files are available for each consented patient as described on the Open Access
Privacy page: http://www.txcrb.org/privacy.html
