Thu Sep 21 10:49:38 PDT 2023: Using GRIDSS jar /projects/rmorin_scratch/conda_environments/35e5df37/share/gridss-2.13.0/gridss.jar
Thu Sep 21 10:49:38 PDT 2023: Using reference genome ""
Thu Sep 21 10:49:38 PDT 2023: 
Usage: gridss [options] -r <reference.fa> -o <output.vcf.gz> -a <assembly.bam> input1.bam [input2.bam [...]]

    -r/--reference: reference genome to use.
    -o/--output: output VCF.
    -a/--assembly: location of the GRIDSS assembly BAM. This file will be
        created by GRIDSS.
    -t/--threads: number of threads to use. (Default: 8)
    -j/--jar: location of GRIDSS jar
    -w/--workingdir: directory to place GRIDSS intermediate and temporary files
        .gridss.working subdirectories will be created. (Default: .)
    -b/--blacklist: BED file containing regions to ignore
    -s/--steps: processing steps to run. Defaults to all steps.
        Multiple steps are specified using comma separators.
        Possible steps are:
        setupreference, preprocess, assemble, call, all
        WARNING: multiple instances of GRIDSS generating reference
        files at the same time will result in file corruption.
        Make sure these files are generated before runninng parallel
        GRIDSS jobs.
    -c/--configuration: configuration file use to override default GRIDSS
        settings.
    -l/--labels: comma separated labels to use in the output VCF for the input
        files. Supporting read counts for input files with the same label are
        aggregated (useful for multiple sequencing runs of the same sample).
        Labels default to input filenames, unless a single read group with a
        non-empty sample name exists in which case the read group sample name
        is used (which can be disabled by "useReadGroupSampleNameCategoryLabel=false"
        in the configuration file). If labels are specified, they must be
        specified for all input files.
    --externalaligner: use the system version of bwa instead of the in-process
        version packaged with GRIDSS (default)
    --internalaligner: use the in-process version of bwa instead of system
        version. Faster but alignment results can change between runs.
    --jvmheap: size of JVM heap for the high-memory component of assembly and
        variant calling. (Default: 30g)
    --otherjvmheap: size of JVM heap for everything else. Useful to prevent
        java out of memory errors when using large (>4Gb) reference genomes.
        Note that some parts of assembly and variant calling use this heap
        size. (Default: 4g)
    --skipsoftcliprealignment: [EXPERIMENTAL] skip soft clip realignment.
        Reduces runtime for aligners that report split read alignments.
    --maxcoverage: maximum coverage. Regions with coverage in excess of this
        are ignored. (Default: 50000)
    --picardoptions: additional standard Picard command line options. Useful
        options include VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT and COMPRESSION_LEVEL=0.
        https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html
    --useproperpair: use SAM 'proper pair' flag to determine whether a read
        pair is discordant. Default: use library fragment size distribution to
        determine read pair concordance.
    --concordantreadpairdistribution: portion of 6 sigma read pairs distribution
        considered concordantly mapped. (Default: 0.995)
    --keepTempFiles: keep intermediate files. Not recommended except for
        debugging due to the high disk usage.
    --nojni: do not use JNI native code acceleration libraries JNI libraries:
        snappy, GKL, ssw, bwa
    --jobindex: zero-based assembly job index. Only required when performing
        parallel assembly across multiple processes.
    --jobnodes: total number of assembly jobs. Only required when performing
        parallel assembly across multiple processes.
    
Thu Sep 21 10:49:38 PDT 2023: Reference genome must be specified. Specify using the --reference command line argument
