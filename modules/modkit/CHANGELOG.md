This release was authored by Haya Shaalan.

The basecaller Dorado converts raw signal of reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long read sequencing to basecalls. Dorado records base modifications such as methylated cytosines in MM and ML tags of BAM files. Modkit is a tool developed by ONT and is used to convert modBAMs to bedMethyl files.
