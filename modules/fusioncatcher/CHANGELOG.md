## [1.0] - 2025-01-17

This release was authored by Ryan Morin.

The [fusioncatcher](https://github.com/ndaniel/fusioncatcher/tree/master) pipeline conveniently has a conda recipe available, which allowed almost all the dependencies to be handled automatically. I haven't incorporated the installation of the reference files into this initial version of the module. Instead, the module expects the user to do that step themselves. Because that step is straightforward, well documented and doesn't require any dependencies, this seemed reasonable to me.
