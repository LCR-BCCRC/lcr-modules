# 🚨 Artifact Alert 🧬

A Snakemake workflow for calculating and aggregating background mutation rates from NGS data to identify technical artifacts and sequencing errors.

## 📋 Overview

Artifact Alert generates position-specific background error profiles from a cohort of samples. By calculating mutation rates at each genomic position across multiple samples, it helps distinguish true somatic variants from recurrent technical artifacts that plague NGS data.

### Why do I need this? 🤔

Next-generation sequencing isn't perfect! Certain genomic contexts are prone to systematic errors:
- 🧵 **Homopolymers** - Those pesky AAAAAAA stretches
- 🔁 **Tandem repeats** - CACACACA causing polymerase slippage
- 📊 **Extreme GC content** - PCR bias anyone?
- ⚠️ **Mapping ambiguities** - Reads getting lost in repetitive regions

This workflow creates a **background mutation rate index** that captures these systematic errors, allowing you to filter out likely artifacts in your variant calls.

## 🔬 Workflow Steps


### 1️⃣ Generate Pileup (`generate_pileup`)
Creates a pileup file for each sample at targeted genomic positions.
- Uses `samtools mpileup`
- Filters by mapping quality and base quality
- Restricts analysis to regions defined in target BED file

### 2️⃣ Calculate Mutation Rates (`calculate_mutation_rates`)
Computes position-specific mutation rates for each sample.
- Calculates mean error rate for each alternate base (A, T, C, G, INS, DEL)
- Applies minimum depth filtering
- Outputs per-sample mutation rate tables

### 3️⃣ Aggregate Mutation Rates (`aggregate_mutation_rates`)
Combines all samples to create a cohort-wide background mutation profile.
- Calculates mean and standard deviation across samples
- Produces final **background mutation rate index**
- One row per genomic position with summary statistics

# Usage

The only required column for this module is "sample_id"

`
import pandas as pd

configfile: path/to/config

sample_table = pd.read_csv(input_file)

config["lcr-modules"]["_shared"]["samples"] = sample_table

include: ".../artifact_alert/1.0/FetchMutationRate.smk"

rule execute_mut_rate_pipe:
    input:
        str(rules.FetchMutationRate.input)
